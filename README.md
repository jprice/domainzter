## About
Domainzter is a simple web app to keep track of domains. It uses [Guzzle](http://guzzle.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) in a combination with JS to fetch information about the domain, 
getting stuff like status, server info and external tools/frameworks/cms and their version used.
Basicly it will look at server headers and scan the html body for known keywords.

Domainzter is built with [Lumen](http://lumen.laravel.com/) <3.

### Demo
A preview of the app will soon be available at [domainzter.com](http://domainzter.com).

## Installation
A few things is required in order to get domainzter to work. It is expected to have some form of webserver and database set up. I'm using nginx and mysql myself.

### Up and running
To get the app up and running, follow these steps:
- Clone Domainzter repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ThomasBS/domainzter.git
```

- Install composer dependencies defined in ``composer.json``
```
$ composer install
```

- Environment configurations need to be set

There's a ``.env.example`` file included in the repo. Rename this file to ``.env`` and edit to fit your settings.

- [Database Migrations](http://laravel.com/docs/5.1/migrations)
```
$ php artisan migrate
```

- Great Success!

Domainzter should now be ready to please your needs.

### Extend/Customize domainzter
If you want to further develop upon domainzter, there's a few additional steps to follow. These steps will (only) be necessary to build the concatinated and minified js and css files (``asset/js/app.js``, ``assets/css/app.css`` etc). You will need to have [composer](https://getcomposer.org/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [bower](http://bower.io/) installed.
Once installed, follow these steps:

- Install npm dependencies and gulp
```
$ npm install
$ npm install -g gulp
```

- Install bower dependencies
```
$ bower install
```

- Gulp will do some concatination etc for frontend stuff (js, less, fontawesome)
```
$ gulp
$ gulp watch
```

- 2x Great Success!
